    \end{quotation}

    % Is for quotations where line breaks are important, such as poetry. Once in, new stanzas are created with a blank line, and new lines within a stanza are indicated using the newline command, \\.

    \begin{verse}
        ``Shall I compare thee to a summer's day?\\
        Thou art more lovely and more temperate;\\
        Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,\\
        And summer's lease hath all too short a date;''
    \end{verse}
